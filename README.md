# Best In Place (Mongoid dynamic fields)

This is a fork of [bernat/best_in_place](https://github.com/bernat/best_in_place) that supports [Mongoid's dynamic fields](http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/documents.html#dynamic_fields). It should not be considered anything close to production-ready, but may prove useful.
